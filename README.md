# FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e
A module for modifying certain sheet functions on Foundry VTT Character sheets for D&D 5th Edition.
Though initially a fork of Hooking's [https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---item-sheet-buttons](Item Sheet Buttons) module, it now includes several roll templates designed for Foundry's 5e sheets to increase speed of play.
